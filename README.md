## About This Project

The goal of this project is to create a blackjack game from scratch that is run in Python. We did not have to include functionality for betting, doubling down, splitting cards, or insurance. We chose to include the function for betting to make the game a little more fun. Good luck! We hope you enjoy our game!

## Run Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/pjkozlowskijr/blackjack`
2. `python blackjack.py`

## Skills Used

- Object-oriented programming
- Recursive functions
- Importing modules
- While loops and for loops
- If, elif, else statements
- Lists and dictionaries
- Team collaboration

## Team Members & Responsibility

We met for two to three hours prior to beginning the code to map out how we would attack the project. In addition, we spent the majority of our time coding on a video call together to work through problems. While we were each responsible for specific items listed below, this was a team effort, and we helped each other troubleshoot our respective sections.

### Patrick Kozlowski
